TRUE,The FREE Lab GUI,"This project focuses on developing a Python-based user interface using Pygame to control and monitor robotic arms in the lab. Goal for the project is to integrate a motion capture monitor with a command interface to enable real-time command input on a user-friendly interface. The Python application will be able to configure motion capture data streaming, communicate with various hardware in the lab such as the Kinova Arm and other in-house developed hardware. The Python application can also serve as a ROS (Robot Operating System) node that publishes and receives packets on the ROS framework.",Python,Fall 2025,10 per week,9/10/25,Runze Zuo,zuorunze@umich.edu,Course credit (ME 490/590),FREELabGUI.png,,
TRUE,Design of High-flow Valves for Fast Pneumatic Actuation,Soft pneumatically-driven robots are currently limited by their actuation speed. This is partly due to the flow-rate restrictions imposed by the valves used to control their actuators. This project seeks to eliminate this shortcoming through the development of small high-flow valves that can be embedded directly into robot bodies.,"CAD, Machine Design, Rapid Prototyping, Data Collection",Fall 2025,10-20 per week,9/11/25,Prof. Bruder,bruderd@umich.edu,Course credit (ME 490/590) or hourly,high_flow_valve.png,,
